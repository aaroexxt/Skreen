# Skreen

By Aaron Becker

## Introduction
After I stopped working on CarOS, which was a NodeJS server that went in my car, I wanted to do something useful with the code that I had made, since it was clear that the original CarOS project was not going to be finished. In addition, I had worked on LutronJS, an application to control the lights in my room. My thinking was simple: I wanted a fully customizeable home controller. Thus, Skreen was born!


## Installation
It's as simple as running the following code:
```wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aaroexxt/Skreen/master/installer.sh; sudo bash ./installer.sh;```

## Screenshots

TBD :)
